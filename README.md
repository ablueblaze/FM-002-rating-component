## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- General Review of project
  Go over all details of the project
  Find an visible/potential pitfalls
  Log anything of note
    I found this project to be pretty straight forward. Though I wasn't sure how I wanted to approach the number list. 
-Basic plan
  Log any special needs for the project
  Build a project_guide.md file
    List all needed details (emails, api codes, ect.)
    List all style guide details
    List all reference material (links, ect.)
    Create a features list
      Block features into potential git working branches
-Start with HTML
  Get all needed/demo content into the page
  Keep classes and id's to a minimum
    This way I'm not creating classes/id's that don't get used

## Continued development

Work on making it more responsive to the page size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This one taught me that there's a time to be clever, and a time to just be clunky. I spent at least an hour trying to find a "clever" solution to highlighting the chosen rating number. Finally I just built a simple class, and had an eventListener handle it. Took me a few minutes, and I was liberally applying head to desk after I got it up and working.
